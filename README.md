```python
def q_runner(self, query):
```
- This defines a method called `q_runner` which is a part of a class (the `self` parameter indicates that it's a method of a class).
- It takes one parameter `query`, which is expected to be a SQL query string.

```python
try:
```
- This starts a `try` block to catch and handle any exceptions that might occur during the execution of the code within the block.

```python
# Execute the query and fetch the results into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, self.session.bind)
```
- This line executes the SQL query passed to the method and fetches the results into a DataFrame.
- `pd.read_sql_query(query, self.session.bind)` uses `pandas` to execute the SQL query. 
- `self.session.bind` provides the connection to the database (which is part of the SQLAlchemy session).

```python
# Commit the changes
self.session.commit()
```
- This line commits the current transaction, which is necessary to save any changes made by the query to the database. 
- It's essential for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations.

```python
return df
```
- If the query execution is successful, this line returns the resulting DataFrame containing the query results.

```python
except Exception as e:
```
- This starts an `except` block to catch any exceptions that might occur within the `try` block.
- `Exception as e` captures the exception and assigns it to the variable `e`.

```python
# Rollback the changes in case of an error
self.session.rollback()
```
- This line rolls back any changes made during the transaction in case an error occurs. 
- This ensures the database is not left in an inconsistent state.

```python
return f"An error occurred: {str(e)}"
```
- This line returns a formatted string that includes the error message, providing information about what went wrong.

```python
finally:
```
- This starts a `finally` block which will execute regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.

```python
# Close the session
self.session.close()
```
- This line closes the database session to free up resources. 
- It's important to close the session after operations are completed.

To summarize, the `q_runner` method executes a SQL query and returns the results as a DataFrame. If any error occurs during execution, it rolls back the changes and returns an error message. Regardless of the outcome, it closes the session to ensure proper resource management.
